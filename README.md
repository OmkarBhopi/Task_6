This project is part of the SQL Developer Internship

Task 6: Subqueries and Nested Queries. 

I used pgAdmin 4 to write SQL queries that include subqueries in different clauses like SELECT, WHERE, and FROM.

In this task, I practiced using:

Scalar subqueries that return a single value

Correlated subqueries that reference the outer query

Subqueries inside IN, EXISTS, and = operators

Nested queries to filter and extract data based on conditions


These subqueries helped me perform complex data filtering and calculations using inner queries. The task improved my ability to write optimized, readable, and logical multi-layered SQL queries.

The project includes:

SQL file containing all subquery examples and PDF file wich contain screenshots of outputs from pgAdmin 4
